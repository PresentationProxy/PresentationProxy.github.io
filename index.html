			<h2>What is a SQL Injection (SQLi)?</h2>
			<p>SQL injection refers to an attack where an attacker can execute malicious SQL statements (known as payloads).
			This is typically done by exploiting poorly designed construction of SQL statements in backend code.
			Hackers can add, modify, and delete data stored in the DB, as well as gain access to sensitive data.
			Perhaps one of the most recently famous examples of an SQL injection were the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne3bv7/equifax-breach-social-security-numbers-researcher-warning">vulnerable Equifax servers.</a>

			<h2>Review of How We Interact with SQL DBs in Class</h2>
			<p>We typically interact with our SQL Databases using Python, Flask, and SQLite3. Database files contain tables with names for each column</p>

			<br>
			<h2>How do we Typically Interact with SQL DBs in Python?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>First, we inport the sqlite3 library. We then create a connection to the database, and from the connection, we set a variable to be the cursor of the connection. After, we execute an SQL statement, commit changes, and close the connection. See the following example:
			</p>
			<br>
			<pre>
				<code>	Import sqlite3
					conn=sqlite3.connect('example.db')
					c=conn.cursor()
					c.execute("CREATE TABLE students (name text, grade real)")
					conn.commit()
					conn.close()</code>
			</pre>
			<br>
			<h2>How Does an Enduser Give Input and Recieve Output</h2>
			<p>The user of a web application like the ones we have done in class gives information in the form of an &ltinput&gt HTML tag. As developers, we store the resulting POST or GET request data in a python variable. For this example, this variable will be <code>userName</code>. In the following codeexample, we print out relevant data to a single user name:
			</p>
			<br>
			<pre>
				<code>sqlStatement = "SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = " + userName
				result = c.execute(sqlStatement)
				for row in result:
      					print row</code>
			</pre>
